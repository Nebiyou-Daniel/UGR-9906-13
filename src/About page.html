        <h2>DANAS Electrical Engineering</h2>
        <p>	DANAS Electrical Engineering, established in 2003, is engaged 
            in electrical engineering consultancy services and manufacturing 
            of energy efficient electric injera Mitad and electric stoves in Ethiopia.
            Danas Electrical Engineering has accomplished several project studies, 
            Electrical design and instillation works for private and government 
            institutions and energy efficiency works.
            To improve the energy efficiency of locally produced injera and cooking 
            stoves, Danas electrical has developed stoves having higher energy efficiency 
            through minimizing heat losses exhibited on the products in the market. 
            The energy efficient Electric Injera Mitad and Stoves are on sale at the 
            workshop of DANAS Electrical Engineering.
